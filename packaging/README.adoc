= Packaging

== rpm with Packit

Install Packit CLI tool from https://packit.dev/docs/cli/#installation

[source,shell script]
----
packit srpm
rpmbuild --rebuild <path to generated srpm>
----

The `packit` tool edits the `packaging/skupper-router.srpm` file.
There is probably some rhyme and reason to what it does, but so far it is beyond the ken of this paragraph's author.
When building, beware of accidentally committing the changes it introduces.

Packit can initiate a local RPM build.

https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/[COPR] builds can be initiated with `packit` CLI, or using the following script in COPR Web UI.

=== Packit CLI (local build)

[source, shell script]
----
packit build
----

=== Packit CLI (remote build in copr)

NOTE: If the Packit CLI procedure fails with ERROR, try the COPR Web UI

Refer to docs for https://packit.dev/docs/cli/build/copr/[packit build in-copr] command.

1. Create `~/.config/copr` as instructed.
2. Authenticate with `fkinit` https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Kerberos#How_to_use_kerberos_auth_with_Fedora_Infrastructure[according to instructions].

Now, initiate the build

[source, shell script]
----
packit build in-copr --owner $USER --project skupper-router
----

=== COPR Web UI

* Select the `Custom` source type.
* Paste the script below in the _Script_ field.
* Specify `git packit` in the _Build dependencies_ field.
* Enter `skupper-router/prepare_sources_result` into _Result directory_ field.

[source,shell script]
