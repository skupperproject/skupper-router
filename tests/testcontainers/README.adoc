# skupper-router testcontainers

_Run container to test a container._

## configuration

Docker or Podman must be available. For Podman, setup the
user podman socket, and configure it in your environment:

[source,shell script]
----
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/${UID}/podman/podman.sock
----

## atomic test containers

Tests are implemented as Rust tests that run various container
images in local Docker or Podman environment. These tests are
used to validate the skupper-router image.

Success or failure of the test is determined by container exit
status, meaning that (usually) all test logic is implemented in
the containers themselves, and the rust test orchestrates them.

## differences from qdr-image tests

Docker or Podman is used instead of Kubernetes. This is to make
setup easier and also to simplify debugging. The disadvantage is
that the API the test uses to communicate with the container
engine is less standardized and docker/podman incompatibility may appear.

Rust is used instead of Go to orchestrate the tests. Neither of
the two languages was yet present in the codebase and it appears
that Rust is more compatible (re. ffi) with a C codebase than Go,
if ever such consideration arises. Furthermore, rust has been
recently discussed in relation to the router, while Go was
only mentioned long time ago (re. the `mercury` tests).

This test suite is much less mature and so far avoided making
most of the decisions that qdr-image tests had to make. When the time
comes, these decisions will have to be made and further differences
may then appear.
