 * Constructor to create a new qd_tls_domain_t instance.
 *
 * Creates a new qd_tls_domain instance that can be used to allocate one or more qd_tls_t TLS sessions.  Searches for
 * the sslProfile in the passed in config and loads the details from that sslProfile.  Logs sslProfile configuration
 * failures to log_source at ERROR level. The returned qd_tls_domain_t instance may be used to create multiple qd_tls_t
 * instances.  The caller must call qd_tls_domain_decref() on the returned qd_tls_domain_t instance to free it.
 *
 * @param config - Pointer to the qd_adaptor_config_t object which contains the sslProfile information.
 * @param qd - Pointer to the qd_dispatch_t object.
 * @param log_source - the log source for logging. Adopted by all child qd_tls_t instances.
 * @param alpn_protocols - An array of protocols supported by the application layer used when performing
 * Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN).
 * @param alpn_protocol_count - The count of elements in the alpn_protocols array.
 * @param is_listener - set this flag to true if the domain will operate as a client (ex. TcpListener), false otherwise.
 *
 * @return qd_tls_domain_t instance on success, else 0.
