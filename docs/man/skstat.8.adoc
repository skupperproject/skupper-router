  - 'topo' - The topological address used for router control messages.
  - 'router' - A summary router address used to route messages to a remote router's local addresses.
  - 'mobile' - A mobile address for an attached consumer or producer.

addr::
The address text.

phs::
For mobile addresses only, the phase of the address. Direct addresses have only a phase 0. Waypoint addresses have multiple phases, normally 0 and 1.

distrib::
One of the following distribution methods used for this address:
  - 'multicast' - A copy of each message is delivered once to each consumer for the address.
  - 'closest' - Each message is delivered to only one consumer for the address. The closest (lowest cost) consumer will be chosen. If there are multiple lowest-cost consumers, deliveries will be spread across those consumers.
  - 'balanced' - Each message is delivered to only one consumer for the address. The consumer with the fewest outstanding (unsettled) deliveries will be chosen. The cost of the route to the consumer is a threshold for delivery (that is, higher cost consumers will only receive deliveries if closer consumers are backed up).
  - 'flood' - Used only for router-control traffic. This is multicast without the prevention of duplicate deliveries.

pri::
The priority of the address.  If the address prefix/pattern is configured with a priority, that priority will appear
in this column.  Messages for addresses configured with a priority will be forwarded according to the address's priority.

in::
The number of deliveries for this address that entered the network on this router.

out::
The number of deliveries for this address that exited the network on this router.

thru::

to-proc::
The number of deliveries for this address that were delivered to an in-process consumer.

from-proc::
The number of deliveries for this address that were received from an in-process producer.

skstat --policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maximum Concurrent Connections::
The maximum number of concurrent client connections allowed for this router.

Maximum Message Size::

routers from edge routers.

Enable Vhost Policy::
Enables the router to enforce the connection denials and resource limits defined in the
vhost policies.

Enable Vhost Name Patterns::
Enable vhost name patterns. When false vhost hostnames are treated as literal strings.
When true vhost hostnames are treated as match patterns.

Policy Directory::
The absolute path to a directory that holds vhost policy definition files in JSON format (*.json).

Default Vhost::
The name of the default vhost policy. This policy rule set is applied to a connection for which a
vhost policy has not otherwise been configured. Processing for the default vhost is enabled by
default and set to select vhost '$default'. To disable default vhost processing set defaultVhost
to blank or do not define a vhost named '$default'.

Connections Processed::
Count of all incoming connection attempts.

Connections Denied::
Count of all incoming connection attempts denied by policy.

Connections Current::
Count of currently active incoming connections.

Links Denied::
Count of all sender and receiver policy denials summed across all vhosts.

Maximum Message Size Denied::
Count of all maxMessageSize policy denials summed across all vhosts.

Total Denials::
Count of all policy denials for any reason summed across all vhosts.

skstat --vhosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

hostname::
The hostname of the vhost. This vhost policy applies
to any client connection that uses this hostname in the 'hostname' field of the incoming AMQP Open.

maxConnections::
The global maximum number of concurrent client connections allowed for this vhost.

maxMessageSize::
Optional maximum size in bytes of AMQP message transfers allowed for connections to this vhost.
This limit overrides the policy maxMessageSize value and may be overridden by vhost user group
settings. A value of zero disables this limit.

maxConnectionsPerUser::
The maximum number of concurrent client connections allowed for any user.

maxConnectionsPerHost::
The maximum number of concurrent client connections allowed for any remote host
(the host from which the client is connecting).

allowUnknownUser::
Set to 'true' this allows 'unknown users', users who are not members of a defined user group, to
connect to the vhost. Unknown users are assigned to the '$default' user group and receive
'$default' settings.

groups::
Count of usergroups defined for this vhost.

skstat --vhoststats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vhost Stats table

hostname::
Name of the vhost.

connectionsApproved::
Count of connections approved by policy for this vhost.

connectionsDenied::
Count of connections denied by policy for this vhost.

connectionsCurrent::
Count of active connections for this vhost.

sessionDenied::
Count of sessions denied by policy for this vhost.

senderDenied::
Count of senders denied by policy for this vhost.

receiverDenied::
Count of receivers denied by policy for this vhost.

maxMessageSizeDenied::
Count of transfers denied by maxMesageSize policy for this vhost.

Vhost User Stats table

vhost::
Vhost hostname

user::
Authenticated user name

remote hosts::
List of remote hosts from which this user has connected to this vhost.

skstat --vhostgroups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Table of settings for all vhosts and groups.

vhost::
Vhost name.

group::
Vhost user group name.

maxConnectionsPerUser::
Optional maximum number of connections that may be created by users
in this group. This value, if specified, overrides the vhost
maxConnectionsPerUser value.

maxConnectionsPerHost::
Optional maximum number of concurrent connections allowed for any
remote host by users in this group. This value, if specified, overrides
the vhost maxConnectionsPerHost value.

maxMessageSize::
Optional maximum size in bytes of AMQP message transfers allowed for
connections created by users in this group. This limit overrides the
policy and vhost maxMessageSize values. A value of zero disables this limit.

maxFrameSize::
The largest frame, in bytes, that may be sent on this connection. Non-zero
policy values overwrite values specified for a listener object
(AMQP Open, max-frame-size).

maxSessionWindow::
The incoming capacity for new AMQP sessions, measured in octets. Non-zero
policy values overwrite values specified for a listener object
(AMQP Begin, incoming-window).

maxSessions::
The maximum number of sessions that may be created on this connection.
Non-zero policy values overwrite values specified for a listener object
(AMQP Open, channel-max).

maxSenders::
The maximum number of sending links that may be created on this connection.
A value of '0' disables all sender links.

maxReceivers::
The maximum number of receiving links that may be created on this connection.
A value of '0' disables all receiver links.

allowDynamicSource::
Whether this connection is allowed to create dynamic receiving links
(links to resources that do not exist on the peer). A value of 'true' means
that users are able to automatically create resources on the peer system.

allowAnonymousSender::
Whether this connection is allowed to create sending links if the sender
does not provide a target address. By prohibiting anonymous senders,
the router only needs to verify once, when the link is created, that
the sender is permitted to send messages to the target address. The
router does not need to verify each message that is sent on the link.
A value of 'true' means that users may send messages to any address.
Allowing anonymous senders can also decrease performance: if the sender
does not specify a target address, then the router must parse each message
to determine how to route it.

allowUserIdProxy::
Whether this connection is allowed to send messages with a user ID that
is different than the connection's authenticated user name.

allowWaypointLinks::
Whether this connection is allowed to claim 'waypoint.N' capability for
attached links.  This allows endpoints to act as waypoints without
needing auto-links.

allowDynamicLinkRoutes::
Whether this connection is allowed to dynamically create connection-scoped
link route destinations.

allowAdminStatusUpdate::
Whether this connection is allowed to update the admin status of other
connections. Note: Inter-router connections cannot be deleted at any time.

allowFallbackLinks::
Whether this connection is allowed to claim 'qd.fallback' capability
for attached links.  This allows endpoints to act as fallback destinations
for addresses that have fallback capability enabled.

Tables for each vhost and user group.

Vhost::
Name of vhost.

UserGroup::
Name of vhost usergroup.

vhost::
Name of vhost.

group::
Name of vhost usergroup.

users::
A list of authenticated users for this user group.

remoteHosts::
A list of remote hosts from which the users may connect. A host can
be a hostname, IP address, or IP address range. Use commas to separate
multiple hosts. To allow access from all remote hosts, specify a
wildcard 'asterisk \*'. To deny access from all remote hosts, leave this
attribute blank.

sources::
A list of source addresses from which users in this group may receive messages.
To specify multiple addresses, separate the addresses with either a comma or
a space. If you do not specify any addresses, users in this group are not
allowed to receive messages from any addresses. You can use the substitution
token `${user}` to specify an address that contains a user's authenticated
user name. You can use an 'asterisk \*' wildcard to match one or more
characters in an address. However, this wildcard is only recognized if
it is the last character in the address name. You may specify attributes
'sources' or 'sourcePattern' but not both at the same time.

targets::
A list of target addresses to which users in this group may send messages.
To specify multiple addresses, separate the addresses with either a comma or
a space. If you do not specify any addresses, users in this group are not
allowed to send messages to any addresses. You can use the substitution
token `${user}` to specify an address that contains a user's authenticated
user name. You can use an 'asterisk \*' wildcard to match one or more
characters in an address. However, this wildcard is only recognized if it
is the last character in the address name. You may specify attributes
'targets' or 'targetPattern' but not both at the same time.

sourcePattern::
A wildcarded pattern for matching source addresses from which users in
this group may receive messages. The pattern consists of one or more
tokens separated by a forward slash '/'. A token can be one of the
following: 'asterisk \*', 'hash \#', or a sequence of characters
that do not include '/', 'asterisk \*', or 'hash \#'.  The 'asterisk \*' token matches any single token.
The 'hash \#' token matches zero or more tokens. 'asterisk \*' has higher precedence than 'hash \#',
and exact match has the highest precedence. To specify multiple addresses,
separate the addresses with either a comma or a space. You can use the
text string `${user}` in a token to specify an address that contains a
user's authenticated user name. If you do not specify any addresses then
users in this group are not allowed to receive messages from any addresses.
You may specify attributes 'sources' or 'sourcePattern' but not both at
the same time.

targetPattern::
A wildcarded pattern for matching target addresses to which users in this
group may send messages. The pattern consists of one or more tokens
separated by a forward slash "/". A token can be one of the following:
'asterisk \*', 'hash \#', or a sequence of characters that do not
include "/", 'asterisk \*', or 'hash \#'.  The 'asterisk \*' token matches any single token.  The 'hash \#'
token matches zero or more tokens. 'asterisk \*' has higher precedence than 'hash \#',
and exact match has the highest precedence. To specify multiple addresses,
separate the addresses with either a comma or a space. You can use the
text string `${user}` in a token to specify an address that contains a
user's authenticated user name. If you do not specify any addresses then
users in this group are not allowed to send messages to any addresses.
You may specify attributes 'targets' or 'targetPattern' but not both at
the same time.
