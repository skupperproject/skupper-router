After using {RouterName} to distribute messages between two clients, you can use the following sections to learn more about {RouterName} configuration, deployment, and management.

xref:configuration[Change the router's configuration]::
{RouterName} ships with default settings that are suitable for many basic use cases. You can further experiment with the standalone router that you used in the _Getting started_ example by changing the router's essential properties, network connections, security settings, logging, and routing mechanisms.

xref:installing-router-{context}[Install and configure {RouterName}]::
{RouterName} is typically deployed in router networks. You can design a router network of any arbitrary topology to interconnect the endpoints in your messaging network.

xref:management[Monitor and manage {RouterName}]::
You can use the command-line management tools to monitor the status and performance of the routers in your router network.
