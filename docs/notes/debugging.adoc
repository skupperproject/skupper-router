=== rr workflow

The rr workflow is to reproduce failure whilst running under rr, and then repeatedly debug the recording until the cause of the failure is understood.

Start by installing the `psutil` dependency for the `scripts/sigforwarder.py` helper script.
Router system-tests may be run under rr through adding the following CMake option

[source]
----
-DQDROUTERD_RUNNER="/absolute/path/to/sigforwarder.py rr record --print-trace-dir=1"
----

Run a suspect test in a loop until failure (at most 100 times)

[source]
----
ctest -VV -R system_tests_websockets --repeat until-fail:100
----

Examine test logs (`.out` files in `tests/system_test.dir`) to identify trace directory of the failing router and run rr

[source]
----
/home/jdanek/.local/share/rr/skrouterd-70
skrouterd: /home/jdanek/repos/skupper-router/src/posix/threading.c:58: sys_mutex_lock: Assertion `result == 0' failed.
thread 'main' panicked at 'Subprocess did not provide exit code', scripts/sigforwarder.rs:130:38
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
----

Start enhanced gdb (rr replay) session with

[source]
----
rr --mark-stdio replay /home/jdanek/.local/share/rr/qdrouterd-70
----

Important gdb/rr commands

* `when`, shows the event number for the current place where the program is paused
* `run 42`, jumps to event 42 (by rerunning the program from beginning while ignoring breakpoints)
* `watch -l some->object`, places hardware watchpoint at the memory location holding the variable
* `reverse-continue`, runs debugger backwards until breakpoint is hit (e.g. watched memory location is modified)

* `thread apply all bt`, show backtraces from all threads
* `frame 42`, sets active frame to frame 42 in the backtrace (current pc is frame 0)
* `p some->object`, prints value of `some->object`
* `list`, shows source code (of current frame)

Note that by default gdb breaks on signals and other such events, so sometimes program breaks "on its own" before your breakpoint is reached.

=== rr record --chaos

The `record --chaos` option randomizes thread switching according to a schedule which rr authors believe is more likely to flush out multithreading errors.
Program execution trace is recorded and may be replayed as usual, even from a chaos run.

=== rr issues

* [Intermittent failure in mutex_pi_stress #1984](https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/issues/1984)
** Fedora rr package crashes with `-> Assertion `t->desched_rec() || is_rrcall_notify_syscall_hook_exit_syscall( t->regs().original_syscallno(), t->arch()) || t->ip() == t->vm() ->privileged_traced_syscall_ip() .increment_by_syscall_insn_length(t->arch())' failed to hold.`
** Using rr built from source (git tip) seems to work reliably
* [Any known rr limitations related to epoll? #3086](https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/issues/3086)
** Some tests would timeout trying to establish inter-router links (purely AMQP functionality) when using epoll Proton proactor, while getting past this reliably with libuv proactor
